# Xiphsound

Based on CakePHP 4, this app allows you to point to an existing Ogg Vorbis collection on disk, and then it will parse every sound file's tags, and store the information in a database backend. The app allows one to update tags, and this updates tags both in the files and in the database, simultaneously. Users can then search for music,
matching terms against multiple embedded tags. Audio playback is possible in the results page.
